## demo/scrollbar

Demonstrate how to get a Qt5 scrollbar to appear.

Uses a QScrollArea object to scroll through lots of buttons, by adding them to the QScrollArea's
contents widget's layout. Whew!

The point is that this can be a model for objects like the grid of count rate buttons on the Observe Tab.
